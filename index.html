  <br>

  <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Brief Description of The Project</h2>
  <p>So, for this project, my task was to setup a linux server to host this very webpage you're viewing on your browser at this moment.</p>

  <p>I chose to use AWS as my cloud service provider of choice. On it, I launched an EC2 instance running Ubuntu as the operating system.</p>

  <p>I created my SSH key for a secure connection to the instance, and I setup network configurations to allow inbound traffic on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS).</p> 

  <p>The webpage is running on an Apache2 server, and you can find the source code and readme file at this GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/dontcatchfire/cloud-exam-project">here</a></p>

  <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">My Bio (with every interesting information about me)</h2>

  <p>My name is Onyinye O. Ibiam and I'm currently living in Enugu town.</p>

  <p>Educaction-wise, I've got a bachelors in Microbiology and I'm currently an employee at a research organization.</p>

  <p>My goal and dream is to transition into the tech industry, particularly into the Cyber Security space. Other areas of interest include: IoT, Native App Development, and Web App Development. I'm picking up Python because I hear it can do stuff, and I want to do stuff.</p>

  <p>Personality-wise, I can be funny or quirky or plain weird - so be warned. But don't worry, you have nothing to fear, except fear itself.</p>

  <p>For hobbies, I really like a good movie. And if you're like me, you know it's the older the better. Or we can say the older the actor, the better the acting.</p>

  <p>Well, I can't give any more interesting information about myself because this is the Internet, the Web. On here, one of the worst things to happen to you is not to get doxxed, but to dox yourself because you're giving out so much information.</p>

  <p>Paranoid? Maybe. Overzealous about privacy and security, ehhh, maybe.</p>

  <p>You can connect with me on <a href="https://github.com/dontcatchfire">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/@dontcatchfire_">X</a></p>

  <p>See you soon!</p>
